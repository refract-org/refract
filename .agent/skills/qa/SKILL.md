# QA Skill

1. Run Biome lint:

   ```bash
   bun run lint
   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```bash
   bun run test
   ```

3. Run build:

   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

4. If any gate fails: fix root cause, re-run. Do NOT chain fix-attempt commits.

## Output

- [ ] `bun run lint` passed
- [ ] `bun run test` passed
- [ ] `bun run build` completed
