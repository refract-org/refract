# A git log for Wikipedia

Refract shows how a page's sentences, citations, and structure changed, revision by revision, with the source revisions behind each observation. It works on Wikipedia and any other MediaWiki wiki.

It runs locally under deterministic rules, with no API key or model. Your review process decides what the changes mean.

<div class="hero-links">
  <a href="demo/" class="button primary">See a captured example</a>
  <a href="quickstart/" class="button secondary">Analyze a history</a>
  <a href="review/" class="button secondary">Review a watchlist</a>
</div>

## Start with one change

On 24 August 2006, the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. Wikipedia's Pluto article went through 43 revisions in under an hour that afternoon. This prints its first sentence from each of them:

```bash
npx @refract-org/cli@0.6.0 claim "Pluto" --text "ninth and smallest" --from 71593043 --to 71601937
```

The sentence starts at "Pluto is the ninth…" and passes through "Pluto was until recently considered the ninth…". The [captured walkthrough](https://github.com/refract-org/refract/blob/main/docs/example-output.md) links each change to its revisions.

For repeated review, [review a watchlist](review.md). Refract remembers the last revision you explicitly acknowledged.

## What you receive

<div class="features-grid">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Changed text</h3>
    <p>Sentence observations include the wording before and after the transition.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Source changes</h3>
    <p>Citation events identify references added, removed, or replaced.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Revision context</h3>
    <p>Events carry revision identifiers, sections, timestamps, and analyzer provenance.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Repeatable observations</h3>
    <p>The same captured inputs, analyzer versions, and configuration produce the same observations. Export metadata can vary.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Files for your tools</h3>
    <p>Export NDJSON for a notebook, SQL query, browser viewer, or downstream review process.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Inspectable history</h3>
    <p>Follow the analyzed revision span. Hash verification checks record consistency; it does not establish complete coverage or authenticate a source.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Choose a workflow

<div class="usecase-grid">
  <div class="usecase-card">
    <h3>Review sources you revisit</h3>
    <p>Inspect pending changes since your last acknowledgment. Keep fetched progress separate from reviewed progress.</p>
    <div class="usecase-steps"><a href="review/">Source-build review guide</a></div>
  </div>
  <div class="usecase-card">
    <h3>Inspect an earlier record</h3>
    <p>Find a revision at or before a date, or compare a bounded span of revisions.</p>
    <div class="usecase-steps"><a href="quickstart/">Quick start</a> · <a href="cli/#refract-snapshot">Snapshot command</a></div>
  </div>
  <div class="usecase-card">
    <h3>Use changes as data</h3>
    <p>Select events such as removed citations and inspect their source context in your own tools.</p>
    <div class="usecase-steps"><a href="integrations/">Data integrations</a> · <a href="mcp/">MCP access</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

## Scope

<div class="split-columns">
  <div class="column-card focus">
    <h4>Available revision histories</h4>
    <p>The CLI fetches Wikipedia and compatible MediaWiki histories. Library consumers can supply versioned text through the shared revision model.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card out-of-scope">
    <h4>Observation limits</h4>
    <p>An arbitrary web URL does not supply a revision history. First observed means first in the analyzed range. Wording changes alone do not establish a dispute or whether a statement is supported.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## One repository, optional interfaces

| Interface | Use it for |
|-----------|------------|
| [CLI and libraries](sdk.md) | Fetch, compare, review, and export source histories; use the built-in explorer |
| [Browser viewer](visualizer.md) | Inspect an exported NDJSON event file locally |
| [Python adapter](python-sdk.md) | Call the CLI from notebooks and read events as dataclasses or DataFrames |

All three live in [the Refract repository](https://github.com/refract-org/refract). Event contracts and reproducible examples are maintained with the engine. The public [review](review.md) and [history-range](usage.md) pages are built directly from those core guides.
