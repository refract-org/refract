## Watch Pluto stop being a planet

On 24 August 2006, the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. Wikipedia's Pluto article went through 43 revisions in under an hour that afternoon. Here is what Refract reports for its first sentence:

| UTC | First sentence | Source |
|-----|----------------|--------|
| 13:39 | Pluto **is** the ninth and smallest of the traditional planets of the Solar system, though its status as a planet has been disputed… | [revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=71593043) |
| 13:40 | Pluto **is** the ninth and smallest of the traditional planets of the Solar system, but on August 24, 2006 it was 'demoted'… | [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=71593165&oldid=71593043) |
| 13:41 | Pluto **was until recently considered** the ninth… | [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=71593296&oldid=71593165) |
| 13:59 | Pluto **is considered** the ninth and smallest of the traditional planets of the Solar system, except by the IAU… | [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=71595967&oldid=71595813) |

| 14:37 | Pluto **was considered** the ninth and smallest of the planets of the Solar system… | [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=71601937&oldid=71601076) |

Rows are excerpts and skip the edits between them. [Captured events](./docs/examples/pluto-events.ndjson) · [Walkthrough](./docs/example-output.md). Article text by Wikipedia contributors, [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Run one of these transitions yourself (Node.js 20+ and network access):

```bash
npx @refract-org/cli analyze Pluto --from 71593165 --to 71593296 --depth detailed --json
```

Each line is one event. The `sentence_modified` line holds the full `before` and `after` wording.

Refract reports what changed. Why it changed, and whether that matters, is for you to judge.

## Who it's for

- **Researchers and journalists** who need to show when a statement appeared, changed, or lost its citation.
- **Developers feeding wiki content to RAG pipelines or agents** who need change events alongside the current text.
- **Anyone who relies on a set of wiki pages** and wants to see what changed since they last checked.

Refract reads Wikipedia and any other MediaWiki wiki. It does not fetch arbitrary web pages; the libraries accept versioned text you supply. Events carry no editor identity, and the [misuse policy](./MISUSE_POLICY.md) rules out editor targeting.

## Questions it answers

| Your question | Command | What you receive | Start here |
|---------------|---------|------------------|------------|
| “When did this text appear, change, or disappear?” | `refract claim` | Candidate text, match kind, latest revision, and status within the fetched revisions | [Inspect changes to a passage](./docs/recipes.md#inspect-changes-to-a-passage) |
| “What did the page say at an earlier date?” | `refract snapshot` | A text preview and revision ID at or before the requested date | [Inspect an earlier record](./docs/recipes.md#inspect-an-earlier-record) |
| “My application needs changes as data.” | `refract export` | NDJSON events to filter, store, or pass to your review process | [Build a review feed](./docs/recipes.md#build-a-review-feed) |
| “What changed in my pages since my last review?” | `refract review` (source build) | Pending changes with full text, source links, coverage, and explicit acknowledgment | [Review a watchlist](./docs/review.md) |

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @refract-org/cli
refract analyze "Bitcoin" --depth detailed --json
```

This reads the page's latest 20 revisions. Use a **page title**, not a URL. For another wiki, pass its `api.php` endpoint with `--api`.

## Try it offline

The offline walkthrough and `refract review` are in this repository and will reach npm with the next release. Until then, run them from a source build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/refract-org/refract.git
cd refract
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
node packages/cli/dist/src/cli.js init
```

`init` runs the analyzers on a bundled **fictional** library history and makes no network requests.

![Three observations from the fictional Rivergate Library sample: changed wording, removed reference, and returned text](./docs/examples/onboarding.svg)

`review` keeps changes pending until you acknowledge an inspected report, then compares later runs against that point:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/src/cli.js review --sample --from 1 --state-dir ./review-state
```

## What Refract captures

| Part of the record | Examples |
|--------------------|----------|
| Sentences | First observed, modified, removed, reintroduced |
| Citations | Added, removed, replaced |
| Document structure | Section changes, lead/body changes, page moves |
| Links, categories, templates | Added, removed, template parameters changed |
| Revision activity | Revert patterns and edit clusters |
| Talk pages and access controls | Nearby talk-page activity and protection changes |

Events can carry deterministic enrichment fields such as change magnitude, extracted terms, and certainty-marker counts. [Event reference](./docs/events.md)

## How it works

Refract compares revisions under deterministic rules and makes no model calls. The same captured inputs, analyzer versions, and configuration produce the same events; export timestamps can differ. Coverage is limited to the analyzed revisions and the matching rules.

A citation does not establish that a statement is supported, and changed wording does not establish that editors disputed it. Your application decides what the events mean.

## Use it in your application

| Interface | Use it when | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| CLI | You want to inspect or export a page's history | `refract export "Bitcoin" --from 369361755 --to 369393212 --format ndjson` |
| Libraries | You already fetch revisions or own versioned text inputs | `buildRevisionEvents(revisions, { depth: "detailed" })` |
| MCP | An agent needs to request histories and receive structured observations | `refract mcp` |
| Python | You work in Python and want events as dataclasses, DataFrames, or LangChain documents | `pip install "git+https://github.com/refract-org/refract.git#subdirectory=clients/python"` |
| Agent skill | Your coding agent should know which command answers which question | `cp -R skills/refract ~/.claude/skills/` |
| Viewer | You want to browse an exported file in a browser | [`apps/ui`](./apps/ui) |

[Library adapter and data integrations](./docs/integrations.md) · [MCP setup](./docs/mcp.md) · [Agent skill](./skills/refract/SKILL.md) · [Private wiki access](./docs/usage.md#other-mediawiki-instances)

## Development and testing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/refract-org/refract.git
cd refract
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
bun run lint
```

The apps are workspaces with their own checks, run from their directories: `bun run lint`, `bun run test` and `bun run build` in `apps/docs` or `apps/ui`. The Python adapter uses Hatch and pytest in `clients/python`. CI runs them in `docs-site.yml`, `viewer.yml` and `python.yml`, separately from the engine gate.

| `@refract-org/analyzers` | Deterministic revision comparisons and enrichment |
| `@refract-org/cli` | Commands and the local browser explorer |
